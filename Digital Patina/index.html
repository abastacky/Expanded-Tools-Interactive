	<div id ="abstract">If patina is the sheen that develops on a material as it ages, how does patina manifest in digital artifacts? This is both a philosophical and a literal question. Many of the digital products and processes we encounter are imperceptible to the human eye, but not truly immaterial. It’s hard to build a mental model of them because they’re either obfuscated by a black box, located elsewhere on a server, or lost to the ever-widening knowledge gap between technology users and technology architects. Digital patina is an exhibition* staged at Gray Area Foundation for the Arts, in conjunction with collaborators from two now-defunct institutions: the Netherlands Media Art Institute and FUSE, the 1990’s experimental typography publication. Works in this collection relate to the grain of the digital world, as it permeates our physical one.

			Tobias Frere-Jones, Reactor typeface for FUSE Magazine's 1993 issue. Reactor was inspired by the spindly embers of a burning building that the designer once witnessed in Providence, Rhode Island. Conflating the digital with the degraded, Reactor decreases in legibility as more lowercase type is set. Each letterform contains “noise fields” that extend beyond the letters themselves, obscuring neighboring ones. The accompanying pamphlet for its FUSE release describes the cumulative effect: “THE MORE YOU TYPE, THE WORSE IT GETS….”

			lyricsprings, 2017. Digital painting on paper. By merging digital image processing with painterly, expressionistic gesture, Cortright defies viewers to reduce her work to any one medium. Each digital file culled from the Internet is parsed into hundreds of Photoshop layers. Painterly digital brushstrokes are added, culminating in a visually aggressive, virtuosic work.

			Petra Cortright, Vvebcam, YouTube Video, 2007. If patina is about the accumulation of surface, and if grain is about the way that an object communicates its own intrinsic objecthood, then Vvebcam shows us both: the layered, hypertextual, distraction-inducing landscape of the Internet, and the uniquely blase voyeurism that characterizes the kind of looking that happens on the web. It reflects back to us not only what we might look at, but also how we might look at it. To follow the metaphor, one could say that the patina of Vvebcam is mirrored.
